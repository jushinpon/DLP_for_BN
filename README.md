DeePMD-kit for DLP Training of BN Materials:

This repository contains all the necessary files and resources to facilitate the training process using DeePMD-kit.

Contents
The all_npy Folder:
This folder contains the essential npy files that include energy, atomic force, and system virial data. These files are ready to be used in the DLP training process. You can directly utilize the DLP_training.json file provided as input for DeePMD-kit to initiate the training.

The tension Folder:
In the tension folder, you will find resources related to the tensile simulation of BN materials. The tensile.in file is a Lammps script designed for tension simulations. Additionally, three Lammps data files are included, each corresponding to a different a-BN configuration: a-BN(0.79), a-BN(1.3), and a-BN(2.1).
